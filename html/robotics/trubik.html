<p class="paragraph">One of the first programs that I created was a rubik-cube solver. I wanted to take it further by building a robot that would use this software to control the robot with arduino and use the camera to scan the colors. The program uses "Fridrich's method" to solve the Cube averagin at 40-60 moves (Not god's number. See. <a href="https://www.cube20.org/">God number</a>). Have to admit tho, that the project was put on ice after finding out the arm's servo motors were too weak. I intend to return to this project and possible rebuild the robot once i'm done with my current projects!</p>

<p class="paragraph">Sadly there is no source code available but the final build is available.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Servo glove was a project to build a robotic hand that was controlled via "Flex sensor" (resistor which resistance changes when you bend the resistor). That was feed in to analog IN on arduino and converted to digital OUT for controlling servo motors that act'd as finger joints.</p>
